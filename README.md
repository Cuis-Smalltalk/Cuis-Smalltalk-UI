# Cuis-Smalltalk-UI
Morphic Widgets and Components for general use

These packages are intended to replace 
Morphic-Misc1 and Morphic-Widgets-Extras 
with a more useful set of 
widgets and widget components 
for Morphic authoring.

Also included are updated versions of
Morphic-ColorEditor and
Morph-MetaProperties.
These older packages are now _depricated_.

The packages here are written for Cuis 6.0.

Morphs considered as components are in packages in the 'lib' directory

```smalltalk
Feature require: 'UI-Components'.
```

Morphs considered tools (LayoutEditor, ColorEditor, MetaProperties, ..) are in packages in the 'tools' directory

```smalltalk
Feature require: 'UI-Tools'.
```
